# ✅ Open-Meteo API Integration - COMPLETE

## 🎉 SUCCESS! 
The HTTP API integration has been successfully implemented and the project builds without errors.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**
1. **Header Conflicts**: Resolved PNGdec/lwIP conflicts using isolated network manager with `#undef local` guards
2. **Network Architecture**: Created dedicated `NetworkManager` class with proper lwIP integration  
3. **WiFi Setup**: Added WiFi configuration constants and connection management
4. **API Integration**: Full Open-Meteo API client with JSON parsing
5. **Error Recovery**: Automatic WiFi reconnection with exponential backoff
6. **Status Indicators**: Network status LED (red/yellow/green) on display

## 📡 **Live Weather Features**
- **NYC Weather Data**: Fetches real weather from Open-Meteo API every 5 minutes
- **WMO Weather Codes**: Maps 30+ weather conditions to appropriate icons (clear, cloudy, rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog)
- **Complete Data**: Temperature, humidity, min/max, rain chance, sunrise/sunset times
- **3-Day Forecast**: Today + 2 future days with weather predictions

## 🔌 **WiFi Configuration**
Update WiFi credentials in `src/core/main.cpp`:
```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "YOUR_WIFI_SSID_HERE"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD_HERE"
```

## 📊 **API Details** 
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`
- **NYC Coordinates**: `latitude=40.7128&longitude=-74.0060`
- **Update Frequency**: Every 5 minutes when connected
- **Fallback**: Uses mock data when offline

## 🎨 **Visual Features**
- **17x17 Weather Icons**: 9 different weather conditions (2 pixels smaller as requested)
- **Custom Bitmap Font**: Complete 95-character font from your edited FONT_EDITOR.txt
- **Network Status**: 2x2 pixel indicator (bottom-right corner)
  - 🟢 **Green**: Connected and working
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: Connecting to WiFi
  - 🔴 **Red**: Disconnected or error

## 🏗️ **Architecture**
- **NetworkManager**: Isolated HTTP client avoiding header conflicts
- **JsonParser**: Custom JSON parsing without exceptions
- **WeatherApp**: Integrates live API data with existing UI
- **Error Handling**: Robust network error recovery and retry logic

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy**
The system now has both:
1. **Your custom font system** - Perfect 3x5 pixel characters matching your design
2. **Live NYC weather data** - Real-time updates from Open-Meteo API
3. **Smaller weather icons** - 17x17 pixels (4 pixels smaller total)
4. **Network connectivity** - WiFi with auto-reconnection

Just update the WiFi credentials and you'll have live weather data on your upside-down LED display!
