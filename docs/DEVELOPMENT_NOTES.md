# Development Progress Notes

## Session History

### Initial Hardware Testing
- ✅ Basic LED matrix functionality confirmed
- ✅ Encoder input working (with some bounce issues)
- ✅ Modular app architecture implemented
- ✅ PNG weather icons successfully integrated

### Font Rendering Attempts

#### PicoVector Approach (FAILED)
- Attempted custom font loading with tiny.otf
- Used Alright Fonts conversion system  
- Multiple conversion attempts all failed
- Always returned red pixel (failure indicator)
- User explicitly rejected fallback solutions
- **Conclusion**: PicoVector unreliable for custom fonts

#### Built-in Bitmap Fonts (PARTIAL SUCCESS)
- Successfully using font6 (smallest available)
- Text renders correctly but positioning problematic
- Rotation causes text to appear off-screen
- Current workaround shows green pixel indicator

### PNG Icon System (SUCCESS)
- Complete PNG weather icon loading implemented
- Uses PNGdec library with embedded C arrays  
- Supports transparency and rotation
- Pixel-by-pixel drawing approach works perfectly
- **Template for bitmap font implementation**

### Layout Issues
- Initial coordinates caused text/icons off-screen
- Python reference shows proper layout coordinates
- Need to translate visual coordinates through rotation

## Current Architecture

```
Apps (WeatherApp, StockApp, CryptoApp) 
  ↓
BaseApp interface
  ↓  
Common drawing functions (draw_string, draw_pixel, draw_weather_icon)
  ↓
Pimoroni graphics library
  ↓
Hub75 LED matrix driver
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Pixel-by-pixel approach works** (proven by PNG icons)
2. **Built-in libraries have positioning limitations** 
3. **Direct coordinate calculation needed for rotation**
4. **Custom bitmap fonts most viable path**
5. **Python reference provides exact layout target**

## Next Phase Strategy
- Use successful PNG approach as template
- Generate bitmap font data with PIL
- Implement custom text renderer
- Match Python layout coordinates exactly
