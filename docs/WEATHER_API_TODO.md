# Weather API Integration - TODO

Due to header conflicts between PNGdec and lwIP, the HTTP client integration needs to be completed separately. Here's what was implemented and what's left to do:

## âœ… Completed
1. **Custom Font System**: Complete 95-character bitmap font from user's FONT_EDITOR.txt
2. **Smaller Weather Icons**: Resized from 21x21 to 17x17 pixels (4 pixels smaller)
3. **Weather Code Mapping**: WMO weather codes to icon names
4. **Icon Assets**: Generated 9 different weather icons (clear, cloudy, rain, snow, etc.)
5. **API Structure**: Framework for Open-Meteo API calls to NYC

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Work
1. **HTTP Client Integration**: Resolve PNGdec/lwIP header conflicts
2. **WiFi Configuration**: Add WiFi credential setup in main.cpp
3. **Error Handling**: Robust network error recovery
4. **Real-time Updates**: 5-minute weather data refresh cycle

## ðŸ“‹ Open-Meteo API Details
- **Endpoint**: `http://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`
- **NYC Coordinates**: `latitude=40.7128&longitude=-74.0060`
- **Parameters**: `current=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m,weathercode&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min,precipitation_probability_max,weathercode,sunrise,sunset`
- **Weather Codes**: 0=clear, 1-3=cloudy, 45-48=fog, 51-67=rain, 71-86=snow, 95-99=thunderstorm

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fix
The current build has the complete custom font system and smaller weather icons working. The HTTP integration can be added later when header conflicts are resolved.
